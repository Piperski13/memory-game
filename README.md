# 🧠 Pokémon Memory Game

A fun memory card game built with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**, using data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Click on each unique Pokémon card once — if you click the same one twice, your score resets! The game shuffles cards after every click and continues infinitely to test your memory skills. 🔁
